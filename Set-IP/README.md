##Setting a static connection between Intel(R) Galileo and PC

###### Why use this approach?
- Access to the Linux terminal of your embedded device
- Does not require the use of not so common cables like FTDI/USB
- Direct connection to the board

###### Requirements
* Ethernet Cable
* SSH Client (like PuTTY)
* ConnMan Network Manager (running on your embedded OS) 

**Please notice that the provided shell script was writed based on ConnMan as the network manager of Intel(R) Galileo. If this is not your OS's network manager, some modifications in the *.sh file will be needed.**
